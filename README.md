## Architecture

+ Express HTML: Express is a backend framework for Node.js, not typically used for front-end development. However, you can render HTML pages using Express by combining it with templating engines like EJS or Pug. This approach is helpful for server-side rendering of web pages.

+ JavaScript: JavaScript is the primary language for frontend development in a MEAN stack. It is used for client-side scripting to enhance user interactions and manipulate the DOM. JavaScript frameworks like Angular or React can be used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

+ Single-Page Application (SPA): SPAs are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update it as the user interacts. Angular is commonly used to build SPAs in MEAN projects. SPAs provide a seamless user experience by reducing page reloads and improving performance.

+ Backend in a MEAN stack typically uses a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility and scalability. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are schema-less, allowing easy integration with Node.js applications. They can handle large volumes of unstructured data and are well-suited for agile development, where the data model evolves over time.

## Functionality

+ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. JSON is derived from JavaScript object literal syntax but is independent of any programming language. It acts as a standard data format that ties together the frontend and backend development pieces in a MEAN stack by facilitating data exchange between them.

+ Refactoring code is necessary to improve functionality and efficiencies in the full-stack development process. Refactoring may be needed when adding new features, optimizing performance, enhancing security, or maintaining code quality. By refactoring code, developers can make it more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.

+ Reusable UI components offer several benefits in full-stack development, such as improved consistency across the application, reduced development time, easier maintenance, and scalability. By creating reusable UI components, developers can streamline the development process and ensure a cohesive user experience throughout the application.

## Testing

+ In a full-stack application, API testing involves testing the endpoints exposed by the backend to ensure they function correctly and return the expected results. Different methods like unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing can be used to test APIs thoroughly. Security testing should also be performed to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the application. Implementing authentication, authorization, and encryption measures can help secure the application against potential threats.

## Reflection

+ Javascript is my favorite language, so I enjoyed the course (despite some technical difficulties). I was enrolled in a MERN stack boot camp before, so this was very similar. I learned, or relearned, how a full-stack application uses components to build the page, API security, and Handlebars.
